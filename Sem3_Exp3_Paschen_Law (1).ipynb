        " Solution: In a discharge tube, after being accelerated though a high potential difference the ions in the gas strike die cathode with huge kinetic energy. This collision liberates electrons from the cathode. These free electrons can further liberate ions from gas molecules through collisions. The positive ions are attracted towards the cathode and negatively electrons move towards anode. Thus, ionization of gas results."

        "Ques: Why does breakdown voltage increase with pressure in gas insulators\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution: A Townsend discharge is when a gas is ionised and becomes a conductor due to electrons colliding with gas molecules. To produce the ionisation of the gas molecules due to collision with electrons, the electrons must on collision have have sufficient energy to remove electrons from the molecules and hence also produce additional free electrons which in turn will produce an avalanche effect and make the gas a conductor.\n",
        "\n",
        "The electrons which potentially are going to ionise the gas are accelerated by an externally applied electric field and must gain sufficient kinetic energy before colliding with a gas molecule for the ionisation process to occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two factors are involved, the magnitude of the applied electric field and the distance travelled by the free electrons between collisions, the mean free path of the electrons.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the pressure of the gas is increased, the mean free path of the electrons is decreased and so the applied electric field (voltage) needs to be higher to accelerate the electrons sufficiently to ionise the gas.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the other end of the scale if the gas pressure is too low, which means that the mean free path is large, the accelerated electrons will collide with insufficient gas molecules to produce the avalanche effect.\n"

        "Solution: Pirani gauges measure the electrical resistance of a filament wire whose resistance varies with temperature. In each case as the pressure changes, heat conduction through the gas changes and so the temperature of the filament changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Pirani Gauge: It gives accurate results at low pressure. Pressure measurement can be read remotely. This gauge is preferred over the thermo coupler gauge, which is another type of thermal conductivity gauge. It is preferred because it is 10 times faster, and a wider range of pressures can be measured."
